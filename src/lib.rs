//! # Taffy
//!
//! Taffy is a flexible, high-performance library for **UI layout**.
//! It currently implements the Flexbox, Grid and Block layout algorithms from the CSS specification. Support for other paradigms is planned.
//! For more information on this and other future development plans see the [roadmap issue](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/issues/345).
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! Taffy is based on a tree of "UI nodes" similar to the tree of DOM nodes that one finds in web-based UI. Each node has:
//!   - A [`Style`] struct which holds a set of CSS styles which function as the primary input to the layout computations.
//!   - A [`Layout`] struct containing a position (x/y) and a size (width/height) which function as the output of the layout computations.
//!   - Optionally:
//!       - A `Vec` set of child nodes
//!       - "Context": arbitrary user-defined data (which you can access when using a "measure function" to integrate Taffy with other kinds of layout such as text layout)
//!
//! Usage of Taffy consists of constructing a tree of UI nodes (with associated styles, children and context), then calling function(s)
//! from Taffy to translate those styles, parent-child relationships and measure functions into a size and position in 2d space for each node
//! in the tree.
//!
//! ## High-level API vs. Low-level API
//!
//! Taffy has two APIs: a high-level API that is simpler and easier to get started with, and a low-level API that is more flexible gives greater control.
//! We would generally recommend the high-level API for users using Taffy standalone and the low-level API for users wanting to embed Taffy as part of
//! a wider layout system or as part of a UI framework that already has it's own node/widget tree representation.
//!
//! ### High-level API
//!
//! The high-level API consists of the [`TaffyTree`] struct which contains a tree implementation and provides methods that allow you to construct
//! a tree of UI nodes. Once constructed, you can call the [`compute_layout_with_measure`](crate::TaffyTree::compute_layout_with_measure) method to compute the layout (passing in a "measure function" closure which is used to compute the size of leaf nodes), and then access
//! the layout of each node using the [`layout`](crate::TaffyTree::layout) method.
//!
//! When using the high-level API, Taffy will take care of node storage, caching and dispatching to the correct layout algorithm for a given node for you.
//! See the [`TaffyTree`] struct for more details on this API.
//!
//! Examples which show usage of the high-level API include:
//!
//!   - [basic](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/blob/main/examples/basic.rs)
//!   - [flexbox_gap](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/blob/main/examples/flexbox_gap.rs)
//!   - [grid_holy_grail](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/blob/main/examples/grid_holy_grail.rs)
//!   - [measure](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/blob/main/examples/measure.rs)
//!   - [cosmic_text](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/blob/main/examples/cosmic_text.rs)
//!
//! In particular, the "measure" example shows how to integrate Taffy layout with other layout modalities such as text or image layout when using the high level API.
//!
//! ### Low-level API
//!
//! The low-level API consists of a [set of traits](crate::tree::traits) (notably the [`LayoutPartialTree`] trait) which define an interface behind which you must implement your own
//! tree implementation, and a [set of functions](crate::compute) such as [`compute_flexbox_layout`] and [`compute_grid_layout`] which implement the layout algorithms (for a single node at a time), and are designed to be flexible
//! and easy to integrate into a wider layout or UI system.
//!
//! When using this API, you must handle node storage, caching, and dispatching to the correct layout algorithm for a given node yourself.
//! See the [`crate::tree::traits`] module for more details on this API.
//!
//! Examples which show usage of the low-level API are:
//!
//!   - [custom_tree_vec](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/blob/main/examples/custom_tree_vec.rs) which implements a custom Taffy tree using a `Vec` as an arena with NodeId's being index's into the Vec.
//!   - [custom_tree_owned_partial](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/blob/main/examples/custom_tree_owned_partial.rs) which implements a custom Taffy tree using directly owned children with NodeId's being index's into vec on parent node.
//!   - [custom_tree_owned_unsafe](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/blob/main/examples/custom_tree_owned_unsafe.rs) which implements a custom Taffy tree using directly owned children with NodeId's being pointers.
